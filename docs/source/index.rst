=================================

   Return to PySNMP Homepage <https://pysnmp.com>

PySNMP is a cross-platform, pure-`Python`_ `SNMP`_
engine implementation. It features fully-functional SNMP engine capable
to act in Agent/Manager/Proxy roles, talking SNMP v1/v2c/v3 protocol
versions over IPv4/IPv6 and other network transports.

Despite its name, SNMP is not really a simple protocol. For instance its
third version introduces complex and open-ended security framework,
multilingual capabilities, remote configuration and other features.
PySNMP implementation closely follows intricate system details and features
bringing most possible power and flexibility to its users.

Current PySNMP stable version is |version|. It runs with Python 3.9+
and is recommended for new applications as well as for migration from
older, now obsolete, PySNMP releases.

Besides the libraries, a set of pure-Python `command line tools`_
are shipped along with the system. Those tools mimic the interface
and behavior of popular Net-SNMP snmpget/snmpset/snmpwalk utilities.
They may be useful in a cross-platform situations as well as a testing
and prototyping instrument for pysnmp users.
